# ✅ Day 18 – Java Threads & SQL Advanced Practice

## 📌 Summary
Focused on mastering **Java Threads**, **Thread Lifecycle**, **Multitasking**, **Thread Priority**, and **Race Conditions** with real-time simulation problems. Practiced advanced **SQL Joins, Grouping, Subqueries, HAVING**, and **Aggregation**.

## 🧠 Java – Threads, Multithreading & Synchronization

### 🔹 Concepts Covered:
- Thread Creation (`Thread` class & `Runnable` interface)
- Thread Lifecycle (`start()`, `run()`, `sleep()`)
- Thread Priorities (`setPriority()`)
- Race Conditions & Synchronized Methods

### ✅ Java Practice Programs:
1. **Simple Delay Thread** – Printing numbers with delay using `Thread.sleep()`
2. **TwoThread.java** – Simulated Downloading and Saving with parallel threads
3. **Priority.java** – Demonstrated `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` and `MAX_PRIORITY`
4. **Race.java** – Multithreaded counters with and without synchronization

## 🧮 SQL – Joins, Aggregates, Subqueries

### 🔹 Queries Practiced:
- INNER JOIN to fetch department details
- Aggregation with `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()`
- Subqueries for comparison
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING` for filtering groups
## 🔧 Tools Used:
--Language: Java (JDK 17)

--Database: MySQL 8+

--IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ / MySQL Workbench

## 🚀 What I Learned:
--Creating and managing multiple threads

--Managing thread conflicts and priorities

--SQL aggregation with real data analysis

--Writing clean and optimized subqueries

## 🔗 Next Up – Day 19:
--Multithreading in Depth + SQL Transactions + Full Stack Preview UI
